# 1. Types of bias
- Motivational
  - Gravitating towards a specific brand or team
  - Only working with those similar to us
  - Letting one ascept take over other aspects of something
  - Comparing the present based on the past
  - Blaming others and/or blaming yourself
  - Finding data that only shows what you want
  - Following the group rather than the self
- Cognitive
  - Not taking in all information
  - Overestimating information available
  - Gravitating towards the positive rather than seeing whole picture
  - Ignoring information
  - Overconfidence

  # The above ideas come from the Module 3 presentation titled *Bias in Information* by Professor Adam Goldstein, and have been rewritten in my own words.

# 2. Risk Management Framework
  - What is a RMF?
    -  According to the *National Institute of Standards and Technology* (NIST), RMF "provides a disciplined, structured, and flexible process for managing security and privacy risk that includes information security categorization; control selection, implementation, and assessment; system and common control authorizations; and continuous monitoring" (Pg 2)
  - Task 1: Roles
    - Compile a list of who will be backing the company's RMF, and what their job will be (Pg 126-127)
  - Task 2: Strategy
    - Develop a method for determining the level of risk your company has (Pg 126-127)
  - Task 3: Organization
    - Put the strategy into motion, and monitor it continually, keeping note of any changes (Pg 126-127)
  - Task 4: Defaulting
    - Create a default of what you can expect in the everyday, such that you can identify when something is wrong/not normal (Pg 126-127)
  - Task 5: Controls
    - Keep a record of what is currently being done as your line of defense for information assurance, and update as needed (Pg 126-127)
  - Task 6: Impact-Preparation
    - Ensuring you know the impact a security breach would have, and a way to resolve it (Backups, etc). (Pg 126-127)
  - Task 7: Wide-spread Monitoring
    - Document *everything* and keep backups. Do not let anything go untouched. Be able to refer back to the information recorded. (Pg 126-127)
    - It is better to have it, and not need it, than it is to not have it, and need it.
