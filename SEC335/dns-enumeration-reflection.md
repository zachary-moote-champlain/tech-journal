# Reflection
---
I had some difficulties with resulting outputs of certain deliverables.
Unfortunetly, bash and RegEx are not my strongest suits.
The main challenges were cutting out certain lines and especially the formatting for the zt.txt file.
I was not able to format the file using the inclusion of `grep -E` due to not fully understanding the arguments for the `-E` switch.

Omitting `grep -E` from the one-liner gave a semi-nice format for the output, but is still challenging to read some of the hostname/ip pairs of the list
