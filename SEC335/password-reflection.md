# Passwords Self-Reflection

- Are your own passwords guessable?
  - my passwords are not easily guessable.
- Are they repeated over multiple systems and services?
  - I do, unfortunetly, use the same password over multiple sites and services.
- Are they included in lists such as rockyou?
  - The passwords are not included in lists like rockyou.   
- How can you improve your password tradecraft?
  - Make every password unique
  - Schedule password changes regularly
  - Ensure MFA for all platforms
- What are you doing right?
  - I do use a password manager, and have passwords that are random, complex, and long, because of it
  - I have multi-factor authentication enabled on a lot of different platforms
